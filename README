Structural and Functional Brain-wide Alterations in A350V IQSEC2 Mutant Mice Displaying Autistic-like Behavior

The dataset contains structural and resting state fMRI data acquired from awake head-fixed mice. 
The cohort consists of 13 A350V IQSEC2 mutant mice and 13 wild-type littermates (detailes can be found in the Subjects file).
Mice underwent multiple rsfMRI sessions followed with a single high-resolution structural imaging scan under anesthesia.
